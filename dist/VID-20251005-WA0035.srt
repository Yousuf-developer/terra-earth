1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Welcome aboard, Dr. Cooper.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,560
First time anyone said that to me in orbit.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,760
I've been saying it for 25 years.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,280
You're the first to answer.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,080
Come closer.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Get her.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,640
Every sunrise, every shadow, every pulse of light, I've watched it all from here.

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,920
25 years of storms, of silence, of hope.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Doesn't it get lonely?

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,280
Only if you forget what you're watching.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,520
Sarah isn't just metal and memory.

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,520
She's the lens through which Earth learned to breathe again.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,600
She mapped the droughts, tracked the wildfires, whispered to the oceans, measured the air

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,720
we once poisoned, and taught us how to heal it.

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,360
You talk about her like she's alive.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,520
After a while, you stop saying circuits.

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,920
You start hearing a heartbeat.

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,920
She watched humanity look back and choose to care.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:48,000
That's what Tara has done for us, Dr. She reminded us we're still one planet, still one

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
home.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,320
And you stayed to witness it.

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,000
Someone had to remember.
